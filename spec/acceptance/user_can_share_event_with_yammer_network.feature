Feature: User can share a sched.do event with her Yammer network

  # Scenario: User creates an event and votes
  #   Given I am signed in as "Bruce Lee"
  #   And I create an event named "Clown party" with a suggestion of "lunch"
  #   And I view the "Clown party" event
  #   When I vote for "lunch"
  #   Then I should see "Share this event with your coworkers"
  #   And I should see "I created an event in sched.do"

  # Scenario: User votes on an event she didn't create
  #   Given someone created an event named "Clown party" with a suggestion of "lunch"
  #   And I am signed in as "Bruce Lee"
  #   When I view the "Clown party" event
  #   And I vote for "lunch"
  #   Then I should see "Share this event with your coworkers"
  #   And I should see "I voted on an event in sched.do"
